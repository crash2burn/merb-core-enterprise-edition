* AbstractController now uniformly uses instance_eval for Procs where previously
  the controller instance (self) was passed as an argument:
  - Procs thrown during dispatch 
  - Procs used as before/after filters
  - Procs used as conditions to before/after filters
  
  This means that code like this:
  
  proc { |c| c.a_controller_method }
  
  Becomes the following for the cases mentioned:
  
  proc { a_controller_method }

*  Merb.orm_generator_scope and friends are renamed.
** Merb.orm_generator_scope => Merb.orm
** Merb.test_framework_generator_scope => Merb.test_framework
** Added Merb.template_engine

Merb-gen is updated accordingly. This let us add --haml and similar
options to merb-gen and plugin generators.

8/10/2008:
* Modified the way Exceptions are handled in the Dispatcher
** To rescue all exceptions, supply Exceptions#exception
** To rescue all Merb-generated exceptions, supply Exceptions#base
** Exceptions#internal_server_error is no longer a catch-all and should
   not be used as such.

Erubis modified:
* <%= %> now can take a block, so <%= helper do %>Hello<% end %> now works
* Erubis buffer is now an ivar (@_erb_buf), which eliminates the need for
  eval in capture helpers.
  
CONSEQUENCE:
Helpers that take a block should simply return a string, and should not
use concat. Example:
  
  def my_helper(&blk)
    "My helper says #{capture(&blk)}."
  end
